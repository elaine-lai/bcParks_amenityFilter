## About
A conventional website developed using JavaScript, Express for server-side logic, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling.

- Utilized Puppeteer (node.js library) to scrape information from the BC Parks website, gathering a comprehensive list of park amenities associated with each campsite.
- Replicated the appearance and structure of the BC Parks website to ensure a seamless and authentic user experience.

## Problem to Solve
Previously, it was necessary to navigate into each individual campsite to view its list of amenities. To streamline the booking process, a filtering system was created. For instance, one could easily obtain a list of all campsites equipped with 'Restrooms with Showers' through a simplified and efficient search.
