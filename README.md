## About
A conventional website developed using JavaScript, Express for server-side logic, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling.

Utilized Puppeteer (node.js library) to scrape information from the BC Parks website, gathering a comprehensive list of park amenities associated with each campsite.

Replicated the appearance and structure of the BC Parks website to ensure a seamless and authentic user experience.
